				<span style="font-size:160%">Our project </span>develops new valorisations of the Istanbul Land (Theodosian) Walls, working with communities to co-produce both situated and web-based, public-facing digital heritage interpretation resources that reflect non-official, hitherto unauthorised understandings of the Walls and their environs. The project also builds capacity, in line with the aims of the Newton Fund, through modelling heritage management/interpretation practice, digital technologies and community engagement within the heritage sector.<br><br>

				<span style="font-size:160%">The Walls are</span> an extensive part of a UNESCO World Heritage Site. They are an ancient structure, much modified in history, famously breached in the 1453 Conquest of Constantinople and now situated in a rapidly modernizing megacity. They have witnessed intercultural contact and conflict, from war to ‘gentrification’, sometimes involving involuntary displacements of communities. The Walls are officially valorized as tangible heritage, and the UNESCO statement of Outstanding Universal Value is based upon the ‘unique integration of architectural masterpieces that reflect the meeting of Europe and Asia over many centuries’. This has shortcomings related to scant engagement with, and involvement of, diverse stakeholder communities. To counter this, the project researchers will research and develop multi-perspectival narratives revalorizing the Walls in relation to different identities, experiences and attitudes to the past, proposing models for in-country urban heritage management/interpretation. This involves three interrelated uses of qualitative research into the lives, attitudes and understandings of heritage of community stakeholders: 
			</p>

			<ol>
				<li> to inform more responsive, ‘bottom-up’ heritage management; </li>
				<li> to engage stakeholders as co-producers of public-facing heritage interpretation, in particular to produce in situ and online digital resources that valorize and present multiple stories;</li>
				<li> to rethink the Walls beyond the paradigm of tangible heritage, based on people’s ‘sense of place’.</li>

			<h2>PI (Newcastle University), Christopher Whitehead, Professor of Museology</h2>

			<p>I trained and worked as an art historian and art curator, but my research activities today are much broader, encompassing museum and heritage theory and practice generally. In connection with this I am interested in the politics of memory, uses of the past, the cultural significance of place and time, identities, social formations and social theory, and interpretation techniques. As well as the working on the Plural heritages of Istanbul project, I also co-ordinate the EU-funded CoHERE project, a €2.5million Horizon 2020 study into European Heritages and Identities, working with 11 other organisations across Europe. For a full listing of research interests, activities and publications you can see my staff pages here.

			<h2>Co-I (İstanbul Bilgi), Prof. Asu Aksoy</h2>

			<p>I am a professor at Istanbul Bilgi University Faculty of Communications and I am heading the Arts and Cultural Management Department since 2016. Between 2010- 2016, I was the director of İstanbul Bilgi University Cultural Policy and Management Research Centre (KPY). After working in the UK on academic research programmes on communications, migration, media and cultural identity, I worked as the international projects coordinator of the arts and culture center of Bilgi University – Santralistanbul. I was one of the coordinators of a major project on the cultural economy of Istanbul, commissioned by the the Istanbul 2010 European Capital of Culture Agency. I was the Istanbul curator of the 5th International Architecture Biennale Rotterdam, Making City, 2012, and I participated in Istanbul’s first Design Biennale in 2012 with a project on informal housing culture in Istanbul. I have undertaken studies on cultural development and cultural heritage management planning for municipalities and public authorities. The study carried out for Eyüp Municipality completed in 2015,is an example, where the main aim was to develop an area management plan for the historic heritage site of Eyüp. Recently I completed an international European Union-funded project titled “Access to Art and Culture: A Comparative Analysis in Europe and Policy Recommendations” funded by the EU Culture 2007-2013 programme.

			<p>I have a background in Art History, Archaeology and Museum Studies, with experience of working in museums in the UK and on archaeological excavations in Turkey and the Middle East. In the Plural Heritages project I am particularly involved in research design, walking ethnographies and community co-production. I also work on the EU-funded project Critical Heritages (CoHERE): performing and representing identities in Europe project. Alongside my work for funded research projects, I study the politics of history in modern-day Turkey. I work with approaches and ideas from museum, heritage and memory studies, visual culture, political science and anthropology.</p>

			<h2>Co-I (Anadolu University), Dr. Figen Kıvılcım Çorakbaş</h2>

			<p>I am Associate Professor at Anadolu University, Faculty of Architecture and Design, Department of Architecture. I am an architect and a conservation specialist, and I hold a PhD from University of Rome, Sapienza, as well as Bachelor of Architecture and MSc in Restoration degrees from Middle East Technical University, Ankara. I have been working at Anadolu University in various research and teaching positions since 2005. I was a research fellow at Istanbul Koç University’s Research Center for Anatolian Civilizations between September 2013 and June 2014, and I conducted research on the preparation of the site management plan of the Istanbul Land Walls World Heritage Site. I have been working on integrated conservation of urban sites (Ayvalık, Bergama, Tire, İstanbul, Bursa etc.), of cultural landscapes like Cappadocia, and archaeological conservation (in Patara, Iasos, Sagalassos etc.). Additionally, I was awarded the first prize of National Competition for the Reuse of Ulucanlar Old Prison (with two other architects), which is an early-modern prison and which was transformed into a collective memory museum.

			My interests include site management, relating tangible and intangible qualities, conservation of urban sites, archaeological and modern heritage sites, as well as narrative-based valorisation, interpretation and presentation of heritage sites. I coordinate the TÜBİTAK-funded project “The Evaluation of the Intangible Cultural Qualities by means of Geographical Information Systems (GIS) in the Site Management Processes, Case Study: the Istanbul Land Walls World Heritage Site”. I am a member of ICOMOS Turkey.</p>

I maintain an active art practice and often work as an interaction designer producing and supporting creative uses of emerging technologies. My research interests include exploring the relationship of creative design research to the emerging field of digital humanities and thinking about technology and public space.</p>
